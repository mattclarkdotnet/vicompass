# Welcome to VISCompass2 for iPhone


Welcome to VISCompass2, the free App that turns your iPhone into an audio compass. It aims to empower the visually impaired crew of sailing yachts to helm on a preset course, or turn or tack in moderate coastal sailing conditions under the guidance of a qualified sighted skipper.

VISCompass2 does not replace any of the skipper’s safety responsibilities for the vessel and its crew.  He or she will normally set up the iPhone, charge-lead, and Bluetooth loudspeaker or earbuds with which VISCcompass2 provides helming guidance to visually impaired crew.  If the weather and other conditions are favourable, this introduction can also lead VI crew (with appropriate coaching and support) to progress to more independent forms of helming, for example, steering to the wind and the feel of the vessel.

Apple VoiceOver and Apple Voice Control

While these apps have been very helpfully used by VI users of iPhones, it is recommended that they are switched off whilst VISCompass is running. 

Walk around VISCompass2 and its Functions

The App’s functions are contained on two navigation screens and adjusted on a third settings screen. 

If the phone has been mounted on the yacht’s centre line (see below), at the top of the ‘Steer’ screen there will be the current heading of the vessel measured in degrees. VISCompass2 uses the inbuilt compass and gyros of the iPhone, so GPS and cell phone coverage are not required for the App to work even in the middle of oceans.

The ‘Steer’ (and the second ‘Compass’) navigation screen is activated and deactivated by the top right forward/pause button.  The ‘Steer’ screen enables VI crew to navigate in the direction of a target heading as set by the sighted skipper.  This can be conveniently set to the current heading of the yacht by holding down the target number for two seconds until the blue circle appears. Or some other target heading can be set by use of the plus and minus buttons on the ‘Steer’ screen.

When VISCompass2 is operating, and the boat’s heading deviates from the target by more than a preset tolerance, coloured arrows and the number of deviated degrees appear in the steer screen.  This information is communicated to the VI sailor via audio beeps - higher pitched ‘chicken beeps’ require a correction turn to starboard, and lower pitch ‘ducks’ say turn to port.  The faster the beeps, the bigger the necessary correction.  When the boat is being steered on course within the preset tolerance, a reassuring signal is selectable (the default being a drumbeat).  At the bottom of the ‘Steer’ screen, two user-selectable settings vary the tolerance angle and the response rate.  Holding down the target plus or minus sign for 2 seconds when sailing close hauled prompts a tack - changing the target by the vessel’s tacking angle (variable in the third “settings” screen with a default figure of 100°), thus enabling the skill of going about to be developed by visually impaired crew.

VISCompass2’s second ‘compass’ screen shows the current heading of the iPhone and the vessel itself if the phone is fixed on the centre line.  When this screen is active, the App outputs an audio read-out of the current heading in compass degrees, the frequency of which can be varied using the slider on the Settings screen.  Some VI crew prefer this form of steering guidance, particularly when motoring or when the course is changing round a series of waypoints. 

Set up a VISCompass2 on board

The iPhone (protected by a suitable case if conditions require it) should be mounted screen up with its top towards the bow, aligned on the boat’s centre line.  It should be attached firmly to the vessel via Velcro, gaffer tape or a car phone mount.

Mount it where the skipper can readily operate the App, but away from any large metallic objects, such as a compass that could cause magnetic interference.  If VISCompass2 is to be run over a prolonged period, a car phone charge lead into the boat’s 12V supply is useful.  VISCompass2 overrides any sleep setting on the phone so note that it carries on working (and using battery power) until the App has been closed.  Incoming calls and messages are not muted though, so selecting airplane mode or voicemail (just while using VISCompass2) is a good idea.

On a calm, quiet day, VISCompass2’s audio output can simply be transmitted via the iPhone’s built-in speaker.  A better (and more audible) solution involves establishing a Bluetooth connection to earbuds or to a small portable/rechargeable Bluetooth speaker near the helming position.  The iPhone’s location can then be safely mounted, say, under the sprayhood.  Practice Bluetooth pairing in advance so it is ready to use at sea.  Wired audio connections work just as well but aren’t usually available nowadays. 

The Status of VISCompass2

VISCompass2 is still being developed as a simple-to-use and stand-alone App good at its core job.  However, enhancements are envisaged which would broaden the sailing experience of visually impaired crew.  For example, course navigation, and yacht instrumentation integration are likely to be included in a forthcoming VISCompassPlus for advanced users.

Conditions of use 

VISCompass2 was developed by IT professionals and sailors giving freely of their time. It is made available to the visually impaired sailing community worldwide free of charge.  It may not be integrated into other software or hardware, rebranded, modified or remarketed without the express consent of the developers.

Need for sighted companion

VISCompass2 does not in any way reduce or replace the skipper’s responsibility for the safe contact of the vessel on which the App is used.  Its developers except no liability for accidents or incidents which take place on vessels on which it is in use.
