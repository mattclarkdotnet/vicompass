# Welcome to VISCompass

_A spoken version of this guide is [available here](./audioguide.m4a)_

VISCompass is a free app that turns your smartphone into an audio-compass. It aims to empower visually impaired crew to helm a boat on a pre-set course or turn or tack it in moderate coastal sailing conditions under the guidance of a qualified sighted skipper.  

VISCompass doesn't replace any of the skipper's safety responsibilities for the vessel and its crew, and he or she will normally set up the hardware on the boat and input the course information which VISCompass then helps the visually impaired crew to steer to. If the weather conditions are favourable, this introduction can also lead (with appropriate coaching and support) to more independent forms of helming, for example, steering to the wind.

## Set Up

The phone (protected by a suitable case if conditions require it) must be mounted screen up facing forwards. It should be attached firmly to the vessel by Velcro, gaffer tape or a phone-mount close to the helming position and where the skipper can readily operate it but away from any large metallic objects (such as the ship’s compass) that could cause magnetic interference.

Standard wired earphones may need a cheap (say 1 meter) extension lead to be comfortable for the VI user, and if the app is to be run over a prolonged period, a car-phone charge lead into the boat’s electrical supply is useful. VISCompass overrides any sleep setting on the phone, so note that it carries on working (and thus using battery power) until the app is closed.  Incoming calls/messages aren’t muted though, so setting them to voicemail is a good idea! Using VISCompass with Bluetooth wireless speakers is pretty convenient and allows more flexibility of where the phone is mounted. Once accustomed to the app, some VIsailors prefer to listen with just one earphone in.

## The Interface

The VISCompass screen contains the following features whose initial set up should be by the skipper:

1. At the top is the current compass heading of phone which is also (if it’s fixed on centreline) that of the vessel measured in degrees true (VISCompass uses the phone's inbuilt compass, not its GPS or gyro capabilities. Hence mobile cell coverage is unnecessary for VISCompass’ full functioning). 
2. Next down the screen is the slide on/off switch.  When switched on VISCompass displays and navigates in the direction of the phone/vessel at the moment of switch on. This target direction is the number displayed below the slider switch. Once set, the target can then be changed using the red and green buttons (one degree per touch).
3. Next down, as soon as navigation is underway, and the boat’s heading deviates from the target by more than a pre-set tolerance, a large coloured number and arrow appear. These indicate the off-course angle and direction. The earphones convey this information to the VI helmsman via audio beeps (higher pitched “chicken” beeps mean turn to starboard, and lower pitched “ducks” say turn to port) - the faster the beeps, the bigger the necessary correction.  When the boat is being steered on course withing the tolerance heading, a reassuring quiet drumbeat signal or an audio readout of the heading (in degrees) is selectable.

At the bottom of the screen are the three user settings- to enable/disable these two forms of on-course feedback; to vary the tolerance angle; and to change the speed of the app’s response.  

## VISCompass Status

VISCompass is still in development, and there are many further potential enhancements to its functionality which would broaden the sailing experience of visually impaired crew. For example, there is the potential of voice synthesized communication of other navigation data (such as boat and wind speed and direction) using data transmitted wirelessly from the vessel's navigation instruments. It is also envisaged that a more user-friendly front end/welcome sequence for VISCompass will be developed, probably available on an audio channel as well as on screen.

## Conditions of use

The VISCompass app was developed by IT professionals and sailors giving freely of their time. It is made available to the visually impaired sailing community worldwide free of charge. It may not be integrated into other software or hardware, rebranded, modified, or remarketed without the express consent of the developers.

## Need for a sighted companion

VISCompass does not in any way reduce or replace the skipper's responsibility for the safe conduct of the vessel in which the app is used. He / she should make the decision as to the appropriateness of the app's use in any given situation, and ensure it is thoroughly commissioned and monitored in use. The developers accept no liability whatsoever for accidents or incidents which take place on vessels on which VISCompass is in use.
