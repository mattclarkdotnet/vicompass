# Welcome to VISCompass for iPhone

_A spoken version of this guide is [available here](https://viscompass.org/audioguide.m4a)_

Welcome to VISCompass - the free app that turns your iPhone into an audio-compass. It aims to empower visually impaired crew to helm a boat on a pre-set course or turn or tack it in moderate coastal sailing conditions under the guidance of a qualified sighted skipper.

VISCompass doesn’t replace any of the skipper’s safety responsibilities for the vessel and its crew, and he or she will normally set up the hardware on the boat and input the course information which VISCompass then helps the visually impaired crew to steer to. If the weather conditions are favourable, this introduction can also lead VI crew (with appropriate coaching and support) to more independent forms of helming, for example, steering to the wind and to the “feel” of the vessel. 

## Apple VoiceOver and Apple VoiceControl

Apple VoiceOver is a screen reader which been helping visually impaired people understand and interact with iPhone screen content for many years. With VoiceOver activated, VISCompass’ layout and controls are audio-described. This can be helpful for initial orientation purposes, but VoiceOver should be deactivated when VISCompass is in use by a sighted skipper, since the only audio output wanted from the phone is VISCompass’ helming feedback. Similarly, Apple’s more recent VoiceControl isn’t recommended for use at sea with VISCompass.

## Walk Around VISCompass’ Functions

1. All the app’s functions are contained on one screen. At the top is the current compass heading of the phone. If it has been mounted on the centreline this will also be the heading of the vessel measured in degrees true. VISCompass uses the inbuilt compass and gyros of the phone so GPS and cell coverage is not required.
2. Next down the screen is the slide on/off switch. When switched on VISCompass displays and navigates in the direction of the phone/vessel at the moment of switch on. This target direction is the number displayed below the slider switch. Once set by the sighted skipper the target can then be changed using the red minus and green plus arrows, enabling the VI crew to helm the vessel through a turn. The increment of target change achieved by each button press is half that of the chosen tolerance setting (described below).   
3. Next down, when navigation is underway with VISCompass switched on, and the boat’s heading deviates from the target heading by more than a pre-set tolerance, a large coloured number and arrow appear. These indicate the off-course angle and its direction.  This information is communicated to the VI helmsman via audio beeps. Higher pitched “chicken” beeps require a correction turn to starboard, and lower pitched “ducks” say turn to port. The faster the beeps, the bigger the necessary correction. When the boat is being steered on course within the set tolerance, a reassuring quiet drumbeat signal or an audio readout of the boat’s compass heading (in degrees) is selectable.
4. At the bottom of the screen are the three user selectable settings - to enable/disable these two forms of on-course audio feedback; to vary the tolerance angle; and to change the speed of the app’s response.
5. A sideways slide of the target minus or plus arrows immediately changes the set target by 100 degrees - the typical tacking angle of a sailboat. This advanced function facilitates the skill of tacking upwind to be developed. 

## Set VISCompass up on board

1. The iPhone (protected by a suitable case if conditions require it) must be mounted screen up with it's top towards the bow and aligned to the boat’s centre-line. It should be attached firmly to the vessel by Velcro, gaffer tape or a phone-mount.  The phone should remain in psition while VISCompass is in use, otherwise course keeping will be thrown off.  Mount it where the skipper can readily operate it but away from any large metallic objects (such as the ship’s compass) that could cause magnetic interference.
2. If the app is to be run over a prolonged period, a car-phone charge lead into the boat’s electrical supply is useful. VISCompass overrides any sleep setting on the phone, so note that it carries on working (and thus using battery power) until the app is closed. Incoming calls/messages aren’t muted though, so setting them to voicemail is a good idea! 
3. On a calm day VIScompass’ audio output can be simply transmitted by the speaker built into an iPhone if it is mounted close to the helm. A better solution is wireless transmission to a Bluetooth "earbud" or to a small portable/rechargeable Bluetooth speaker at the helming position. Wired earphones also work , though are nowadays generally superceded by bluetooth devices. Using bluetooth,  the phone can be more safely mounted, say, under the sprayhood. Practice Bluetooth pairing in advance.
4. Earbuds usually receive all an iPhone’s audio-outputs (so they’ll interrupt VISCompass when calls come in unless silenced). However iPhones cleverly detect when Bluetoothed to a speaker, and only send it music sounds, not calls, not message alerts, but also not VISCompass outputs. So if using a speaker or if your earbuds dont pick up VISCompass sounds, overcome this with the Settings adjustment described below.

## Settings for Bluetooth use (Usually only needed for speakers)

1. Check VISCompass is not running on iPhone, nor any other sound or music outputting apps like Spotify. 
2. Switch on Bluetooth speaker/earbud and put it into Bluetooth pairing mode (which sometimes only runs for a little while)
3. To pair your phone with the speaker/earbud
  - Go to the iPhone’s “Settings” and select Bluetooth  
  - On its Bluetooth page check Bluetooth is switched on
  - If it isn’t already showing as “connected”, touch the line showing the name of your speaker or earbud(eg  “Sony SRS”) which should then show “connected”.
4. Touch the circled i on the same line which should open a new page 
5. If the "device type" option is available, touch that label, and on the page that opens up select “headphone” if not already.
 6. Open VISCompass on your iPhone and check that its drumbeat, duck and chicken noises now emerge from your bluetooth device.
7. Reverse this process when you want your loudspeaker just to deliver iPhone music again. 

## VISCompass Status

VISCompass is still being developed to maintain its capability, with a focus on being a simple to use standalone app which is great at its core job.  There are many further developments in train to broaden the sailing experince of visually imparied crew.  Fr exmaple course navigation, or instrument integration.  These are likely to be included in a forthcoming "VISCompass Plus" for advanced users, rather than in VISCompass. 

## Conditions of use

The VISCompass app was developed by IT professionals and sailors giving freely of their time. It is made available to the visually impaired sailing community worldwide free of charge. It may not be integrated into other software or hardware, rebranded, modified, or remarketed without the express consent of the developers.

## Need for a sighted companion

VISCompass does not in any way reduce or replace the skipper's responsibility for the safe conduct of the vessel in which the app is used. He / she should make the decision as to the appropriateness of the app's use in any given situation, and ensure it is thoroughly commissioned and monitored in use. The developers accept no liability whatsoever for accidents or incidents which take place on vessels on which VISCompass is in use.
