A compass with audio feedback for visually impaired sailors

## Background

Blind or visually impaired sailors steering to a course cannot see the compass or the horizon.  Instead they commonly use a custom built piece of hardware which gives an audible indication of how far off a set course they are, similar to the proximity warning sounds of a reversing car.

VI Compass builds the same functionality into an app using the built in compass of a smartphone.  This has many advantages such as being much cheaper than using one of the very few hardware systems in existence, enabling the use of standard accesibility features, and individual setting of sensitivity and smoothing for different sea conditions.
