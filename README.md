# VISCompass
A compass with audio feedback for visually impaired sailors

## Background

The sport of sailing effectively empowers blind or visually impaired sailors people in many ways , but when steering  to a course, they cannot see the compass or the horizon.  In some conditions they can steer to the wind , but they commonly also use a custom built piece of hardware which gives an audible indication of how far off a set course they are, similar to the proximity warning sounds of a reversing car.

VISCompass builds the same functionality into an app using the built in compass of a smartphone.  This has many advantages such as being much cheaper than using one of the very few hardware systems in existence, enabling the use of standard accesibility features, and individual setting of sensitivity and smoothing for different sea conditions. The use of a smartphone also opens up possibilies for onshore , pre voyage practice , plus developments such as speech activation , vibrate and stereo operation .

The Interaction Model around which VISCompass is built is as follows. 

Use by mixed sighted and VI crew on yachts and motorboats with a secure steering position

Hardware requirement (currently) iphone running iOS version... or above ; well charged (or supplied with external power) and set to non-sleep operation , plus mono or stereo  headphones . If wired , headphones trpically require a lead of at least 1.2 M. The app is optimised for bluetooth stereo headphones .

Depending upon the other uses which the phone is put to , it may require compass calibration (similar to that occasionally required to utilize map/satnav funcionality) before VISCompass will operate. Instructions for this easy 30 second task will be provided by the app if necessary. 

The operative iPhone is securelt attached to the vessels structure away from metallic sources of compass interference and accessable by both the VIsailor and the sighted skipper. While autonomous useage modes are envisaged in future , the initial location access priority is for skipper input. If wave and weather conditions require it , the iPhone should be mounted in a waterproof and/or protective case which still allows easy access by all crew and touch screen operation .

Optimum ( but not essential)orientation of the iPhone is along the centreline of the boat. Only in this way do its compass readings and those of the vessel coincide.  

Initially the tine and frequency of "beeps" heard through the earphones provide steering feedback to the VISailor . Stereo channel and vibrate communication modes will be developed later. In mono mode the earphone can be used in either ear.

Setting and changing course is done via buttons in the VISCompass app operational navigation screen , and can be done by dialling in a compass bearing , or by selecting an insantanious vesses course for the app (and thus the VISailor) to lock onto. Changing course can be accomplished by keying in a comass course increase or desrease (before commencing the turn) , of by resetting the target bearing after a deliberate turn has been made

Sighted helmsmen rarely steer mre accurately than plus or minus 5 degrees of their target. VISCompass also only starts emitting off course correction beeps at plus or minus 5 degrees , to avaiod oversteering . In-app functionality provides further feedback  sensitivity adjustment to suit the VI user.


The VISCompass app was deveoped by IT and Sailing experts giving freely of their time , and is made availble to the visually impaired sailing community free of charge. It may not be integrated into other software or hardware , rebranded , modified , or remarketed without the express consent of the developors (Alchemy consulting?...Matt's company?...whatever) 

VISCompass does not in any way reduce or replace the skipper's responsibility for the safe conduct of the vessel in which the app is used. He / she should make the decision as to the appropriateness of its use in any situation , and ensure it is thoroughly commissioned and monitored in use. The developers accept no liability whatsoever for accidents or incidents which take place on vessels on which VISCompass is in use.
